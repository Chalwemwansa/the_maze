welcome to the maze created by Chalwe Mwansa, i built the game to this level alone as a portfolio project for ALX-SE.
i chose it as it is challenging and involves some math and physics which required me to think and at least uuse my head while coding
i had to learn c++ as well which was fun and made a class using it afterwards which i found interesting
MOVEMENTS
  to move the player back and forth, use the up and down arrow keys
  to change the players direction use the side arrow keys
  to change the players weapon use CTRL-c (control c)
