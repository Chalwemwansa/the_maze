INTRO TO PROJECT
  welcome to the maze created by Chalwe Mwansa, i built the game to this level alone as a portfolio project for ALX-SE.
  i chose it as it is challenging and involves some math and physics which required me to think and at least uuse my head while coding
  i had to learn c++ as well which was fun and made a class using it afterwards which i found interesting

CHALLENGES
  - it was difficult to get a window to open up on screen as i was using windows 10 to build in wsl and hence i needed a X-Server and configuring it to open a window
  - the other challenge was understanding the math part of the project which took me some time
  - being expected to finish the project in 2 weeks was also a challenge but i am glad to say that i completed most of the requirements

MOVEMENTS
  to move the player back and forth, use the up and down arrow keys
  to change the players direction use the side arrow keys
  to change the players weapon use CTRL-c (control c)
